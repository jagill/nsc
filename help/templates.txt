Block Reference
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

A block is a collection of text and/or images to place in a particular spot on a card.


REQUIRED FIELDS:

name - The name of the block.


OPTIONAL FIELDS:

content - The text and/or images to place in the block. Default is "".
Formatting:
	Directly write text.
	For images, use "\\image_name", where a file like image_name.jpg or image_name.png is in the Nothing Sacred Cards art/full or art/inline directories.
	Use "\\attribute" to reference attributes of a particular card. For example, if each card has a suit image and you want to display the card's suit image in a block, include "suit":"\\image" in the card file, then include "\\suit" in the template content string.
	"\\n" creates a new line.
	"\\lp" creates a new line with 1/8" of white space before it.
	"\\b" and "\\i" turn on and off bold and italic, respectively.
	"\\font:font_choice" will switch the font to font_choice. "\\font:default" will return the font to the default font for the block.
	"\\color:color_choice" will switch the font color to color_choice. color_choice can be a key from constants.COLOR_MAP, or it can be in the form (R,G,B). "\\color:default" will return the font color to the default color for the block.

	*"\\block_name:pos_word" - A position relative to another block. The block must be defined before this one.
	*any number - That many pixels right or down from the top left corner of the card.

anchor_x, anchor_y - The point on the block that will be placed at the position. Defaults are "left" and top".
Legal options:
